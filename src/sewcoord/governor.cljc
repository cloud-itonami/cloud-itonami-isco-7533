(ns sewcoord.governor
  "SewCoordGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating every
  sewing/embroidery workshop scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor
  may make for a sewing/embroidery workshop crew. ISCO-08 7533
  (Sewing, Embroidery and Related Workers) operates sewing/embroidery
  machines — a standard workshop hazard profile (needle-puncture
  injury, moving-machine-part injury) — so this governor's
  hazard-escalation path names that profile explicitly
  (needle-puncture-hazard / machine-part-hazard /
  equipment-condition). The governor never dispatches hardware
  itself, never performs sewing or embroidery work itself, and never
  finalizes a sewing/embroidery-execution decision (e.g. deciding a
  sewing or embroidery job is finished) or a workshop-safety-
  clearance decision (e.g. declaring a workshop or item
  safety-cleared), nor overrides a shop safety officer's judgment —
  those are permanently out of this actor's scope and remain a shop
  safety officer's exclusive judgment (README's 'Robotics premise':
  this actor coordinates WORKSHOP SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it
  never performs sewing or embroidery work or makes safety-clearance
  decisions itself). Modeled closely on cloud-itonami-isco-7319's
  craftcoord.governor (closest domain shape — a published, tested
  generic workshop scheduling/logistics coordination pattern).

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. worker provenance      — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. workshop provenance    — the workshop site must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never performs sewing or embroidery
                                work itself; it only gates what the
                                advisor may coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize a
                                sewing/embroidery-execution decision
                                (e.g. deciding a sewing or embroidery
                                job is finished) or a
                                workshop-safety-clearance decision
                                (e.g. declaring a workshop or item
                                safety-cleared), or to override a shop
                                safety officer's judgment, is a hard,
                                permanent block (checked both against
                                the proposed :op and, defense-in-
                                depth, against the proposal's
                                :rationale text — matched as full
                                finalization/execution ACTION phrases
                                such as \"finalize the sewing
                                operation\" / \"declare the workshop
                                safety cleared\" / \"override the shop
                                safety officer's judgment\", never as
                                bare nouns like \"sewing\",
                                \"embroidery\" or \"safety\", so the
                                check can never self-trip on the
                                advisor's own routine rationale text,
                                e.g. \"logged work record for worker
                                …\" or \"scheduled crew operation for
                                sewing/embroidery task …\" or \"…
                                routed for shop safety officer
                                review\" — all three legitimately
                                contain those bare nouns but none is a
                                finalization action, and all are
                                exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
    6. :op :flag-safety-concern (a needle-puncture-hazard /
                                machine-part-hazard /

                                escalates to a human, never
                                auto-commits).
